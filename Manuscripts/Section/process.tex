Even if the data sources underlying the computations are verified and all of the software, hardware, and operating systems are available and can be used, reproducibility is not guaranteed.  The output of those programs, in our case, depended on initial values for parameters that we had to select and enter.  Without a record of which parameter values were used to obtain the results reported in the paper, and without mathematical guarantees that the results are insensitive to starting values, we cannot be certain as to how the results were actually obtained.  (This was a major motivation for \citet{Buckheit:1995hl}.)
