	``Reproducible Research (RR) is the practice of distributing, along with a research publication, all data, software source code, and tools required to reproduce the results discussed in the publication.'' ---James Ware (\citeyear{Ware:2010aa})

Elements needed for reproducibility:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the underlying \z{data},
		\item the \z{computer programs} or scripts used for calculation,
		\item the \z{computing environment} (hardware and OS) under which those programs were run, and
		\item the choices of \z{inputs to the calculations}.
	\end{enumerate}
