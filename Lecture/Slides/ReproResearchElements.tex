	``Reproducible Research (RR) is the practice of distributing, along with a research publication, all data, software source code, and tools required to reproduce the results discussed in the publication.'' ---James Ware (\citeyear{Ware:2010aa})
	
	\bigskip

Components of a research project compendium that affect reproducibility:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the underlying data,
		\item the computer programs or scripts used for calculation,
		\item the hardware and operating system under which those programs were run, and
		\item the choices of inputs to the calculations, and the process by which those choices were made.
	\end{enumerate}
