	\begin{itemize}
		\item Data set provenance is important to document
		\item Documentation written today will repay itself many times over tomorrow (or 40 years hence)
		\item Version control tools with good repository management (such as \texttt{git} with GitHub) are essential \textit{especially for data sets}
		\item Computer environments change over time; repository tune-up every few years may be necessary.  There won't always be a Wang~2200 emulator available.
		\item Programs that require tuning parameters won't reproduce results unless \textit{the settings used in the published product are preserved.}
		\item A narrative compiled as the work progresses and preserved as a ``lab notebook'' can be invaluable in reproducing both what was done, and why
