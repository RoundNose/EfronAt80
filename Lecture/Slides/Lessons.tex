	\frametitle{Lessons concerning reproducibility}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item Because {\color{ForestGreen}data sets, programs, computing environment, parameter choices} evolve:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Need to track and preserve successive versions
		\item Need archived snapshot linking specific data, program versions to specific versions of the manuscript
		\item Good version control tools make this possible
	\end{itemize}
	\item Programs are not enough; need to know what they were trying to do (and why)
	\item Programs that require tuning parameters won't reproduce results unless \textit{the settings used in the published product are preserved.}
	\item Archiving contemporaneous notes can help immensely.
	\item Reproducibility decays with time. (There won't always be a Wang 2200 emulator). Repositories need regular tune-ups.
\end{itemize}
