	There are a number of questions related to the \textit{data} that went in to the ET 1975 calculations
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We have taken Table~1 from ET as given for this talk, but\dots
		\item The ``simple unbiased estimator'' for $\hat\Delta(1)$ calculated from Table~1 is 11486, not the 11430 reported in the paper!
		\item The only tabulation of the data in my paper archive is a hand-written one that differs from Table~1 in several entries
		\item Going back to Spevack to resolve discrepancies shows that Table~1 is largely correct, with a handful of entries that differ by~1 or~2, but one entry ($n_4$) that is too small by 110.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Fortunately, these discrepancies have little effect on the conclusions of the paper.
