	{\small Excerpt from inputs to the Wang 2200 BASIC program calculating the likelihood-ratio $\chi^2$ statistics (left), and the corresponding outputs (right).  The first six rows of output match both the 1975 computer printout and the entries in Table~3 of ET.  The last row shows the actual MLEs for $x_0=40$; the $\chi^2$ value is somewhat reduced from the value in ET.}
