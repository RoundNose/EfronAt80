    \frametitle{Good News and Bad News}
	\emph{Good news:}  The Wang 2200 has a cult following, and there is an emulator that faithfully reproduces the microcode.
	
	\bigskip
	\emph{More good news:}  The BASIC program actually runs!
	
	\bigskip
	\emph{Bad news:} The ``iterative search'' requires repeated manual inputs, which I didn't write down.
	
	\bigskip
	\emph{More bad news:} I was unable to find values of the inputs that automatically lead to the output parameter values in ET.
	
	\bigskip
	\emph{Some redeeming good news:} The program does reproduce the LR $\chi^2$ values in the paper---and my archived printouts.
